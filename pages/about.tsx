                  Driven by a curious imagination and a passion for pushing the
                  boundaries of electronic music, Justin Wavesâ€™ multi-decade
                  experience as a composer, producer, instrumentalist and
                  songwriter has narrowed into a solid focus: spread positivity
                  and healing in the world through dance music. Its hard to
                  describe this San Francisco-based artistâ€™s music with a single
                  word or genre as his music creates a dynamic landscape
                  combining the polarity of feminine and masculine energies all
                  while keeping the steady momentum of the dance floor. As a
                  Live Performer/ Vocalist, he has opened for such acts as
                  TÃ©lÃ©popmusik, Kraak & Smaak, Alex Cruz, Oona Dahl and has
                  delivered all-original live sets at festivals such as Outside
                  Lands and Northern Nights. As a DJ, Justin has well over a
                  decade of experience keeping the vibes high at countless
                  Burning Man events such as Temple Galaxia fundraiser and the
                  Never Sleep Again Campouts and has captained the decks at
                  nearly every nightclub in San Francisco, bringing a wavy blend
                  of organic deep and tech house to the table. With a passion
                  for connecting with others through the language of music,
                  Justin Waves is dedicated to using his music as a platform
                  free people from concern and live fully in the present moment.
